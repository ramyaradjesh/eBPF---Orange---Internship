The files that are presented are the main findings from my internship at Orange Telecom. The work was based on finding eBPF as a viable feature to increase the security of mobile environment. During the research, I investigated various Mobile OS that uses eBPF, Android is uses eBPF for networking, data usage statistics, Fast packet Processing etc. Further more, I investigated various research papers that used eBPF as medium to increase security in peripherals system, embedded devices, sys call security, Native code protection for Android Apps, Protecting security modules etc. through which I was able to upgrade my knowledge about eBPF and created a report to find the most popular eBPF operation. Please take a look at this eBPF link to learn more about eBPF (https://ebpf.io).
